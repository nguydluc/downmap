            Discover the Best Dining and Networking Spots in Downtown Calgary
          </h1>
          <p>
            Downtown Calgary has become quite the hub for corporate
            professionals, especially in the downtown commercial area and with
            the Calgary weather sometimes lunch options are limited. This map
            offers a variety of different locations for whatever the event;
            whether itâ€™s meeting a client, networking with other professionals
            or just looking for something to eat, all these locations are a
            short distance from the Plus 15 Network.
